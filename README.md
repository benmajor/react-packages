# React Packages

This repo exists as a single point-of-entry for the various React/Native packages, components and libraries I have come across and use frequently. These are generally well-maintained projects, or achieve a very specific aim. 

Each one is available as an NPM module, with some caveats for the use of `craco`, and others specifically requiring Yarn as the package manager.

[`react-debounce-input`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-debounce-input)  
React component that renders an Input, Textarea or other element with debounced onChange. Can be used as drop-in replacement for `<input type="text" />` or `<textarea />`

[`react-cookie`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cookie)  
Very clean React/Native implementation of [`universal-cookie`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/universal-cookie).
